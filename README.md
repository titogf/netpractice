# NetPractice 🌐

Welcome to the **NetPractice** project! This project is designed to help you solve networking problems to make a network run correctly. You'll use a web-based interface to configure network diagrams and ensure they operate as expected.

## Overview 📜

**NetPractice** consists of a series of networking exercises where you’ll configure a network diagram to achieve specific goals. The goal is to solve network issues and properly configure the network using a provided HTML interface.

## Getting Started 🚀

1. **Download the Files**:
   - Download the file attached to the project’s page.

2. **Extract the Files**:
   - Extract the contents of the downloaded file into a folder of your choice.

3. **Open the Interface**:
   - Navigate to the extracted folder and open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

4. **Interface Overview**:
   - You should see the **NetPractice** interface with various options and network diagrams.

## Using the Interface 💻

- **Login**: 
  - You can input your login details in the field provided to practice.
  - If you leave the field empty, you can try the ‘correction’ version.

- **Levels**:
  - There are 10 levels available, each with a non-functioning network diagram.
